            <p>The book is <strong>very much</strong> a work in progress. Even
              with that, there are two versions!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="first-edition/">First edition</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="second-edition/">Second edition</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We started with the first edition, but before we even finished
            it, some new awesome stuff popped up, and so we're starting
            over.</p>
            <p>That said, we're just starting, so the second edition is
            basically blank at the moment. Check out the first edition for now,
            and
            hopefully the second will be awesome soon.</p>
